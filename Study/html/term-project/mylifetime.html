        <h1>My 20 years life time</h1>
        <p>I'm really ordinary student just like others. I was borned in korea at 2001 november. I used to study English with my mom.
          She was teaching kindergarten at that time. I went to academy to learn English where my mom worked. It was secret to my friends that my mom was teacher.</p>
        <p> My family moved about 4 to 5 times. Among those times, one of my favorite apartments was at bundang. I lived at there for about 7 years. I had lots of memories at there.
            I'm living alone right now. These days korea and other countries are having difficulty in housing issues. The price is too high. So, I'm living in my aunt's house. Luckily she is staying with grandparents.</p>
